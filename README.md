# @RealTalkCrypto
RealTalkCrypto is a twitter bot that has been trained to mimic the cryptocurrency subreddit: www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency.
RealTalkCrypto has been trained on 130K words taken from /r/cryptocurrency, and so, is quite adept at imitating the average reddit user.
Additionally, RealTalkCrypto is very emotional - sometimes he tweets about things he likes, and sometimes he tweets about things he dislikes.
This is accomplished by doing sentiment analysis on his tweets before he posts them.
